# Tasks: AI-Powered Dependency Tracking System

**Feature**: 001-ai-dependency-tracker
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ai-dependency-tracker/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), spec.md (✓), research.md (✓), data-model.md (✓), contracts/ (✓), quickstart.md (✓)

## Dependencies Between Tasks

### Phase Dependencies (Sequential)

```
Phase 1 (Setup) → Phase 2 (Foundational) → Phase 3-6 (User Stories) → Phase 7 (Polish)
```

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: Independent - can start immediately after Phase 2
- **US2 (P2)**: Depends on US1 (needs detector + manifest packages)
- **US3 (P3)**: Depends on US1 (needs manifest to monitor), partially depends on US2 (uses merge logic)
- **US4 (P4)**: Depends on US1, US2, US3 (validation of all features)

### Critical Path

```
Setup (T001-T010) → Foundational (T011-T025) → US1 (T026-T047) → US2 (T048-T059) → US3 (T060-T083) → US4 (T084-T092) → Polish (T093-T110)
```

```

### Phase 3 - US1 Tests
```
T026, T027, T028, T029, T030 can all run in parallel
```

### Phase 3 - US1 Implementation
```
Parallel Group: T033, T035, T036, T037, T038 (different files)
